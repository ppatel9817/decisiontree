# Decision Tree Classification on German Credit Data

Overview

This project demonstrates the application of a Decision Tree Classifier on the German Credit Data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether a customer will default based on various financial and personal attributes.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the German Credit Data, which can be found here [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data]. It consists of 21 columns and 1000 rows, where each row represents a customer, and the columns include various features such as credit history, duration, purpose, and more. The target variable is ‘Default’.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	pandas
	•	scikit-learn
	•	matplotlib

Results

	•	The accuracy of the model is printed in the console.
	•	The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
	•	The confusion matrix shows the performance of the classification model.
	•	The decision tree is plotted to visualize the decision rules.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer default on credit. The preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and visualization are all covered in the code.
